### Developing

You can either build directly using your system's cargo installation and library dependencies or use devenv

#### devenv
If you have [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) installed just pop into a shell `devenv shell` and continue building. This also works from devcontainers / github codespaces

### Dependencies

You'll need to install the following dependencies (note, that those package
names may vary depending on your OS and linux distribution):

- `libwayland`
- `libxkbcommon`

### Build and run

```
cargo run
```
